# Server API Storage
This script is useful for saving inventory tools and items in Roblox servers and retrieving that saved data later on.
I am currently utilizing this script in my newest game project, **Yuhario, Eastern District**, on *Roblox*.
This script is written in Lua utilizing Roblox's "Script" system in Roblox Studio.

# Bugs and Problems #
While this script is effective, it does not properly remove the assets when the player is dead or resets (health = 0), rather opting to continuously save the item in the user's inventory.
I will be working to fix this soon!!!
